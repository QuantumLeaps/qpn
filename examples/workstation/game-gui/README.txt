The Win32 GUI emulation of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game example for the
EFM32-SLSTK3401A board from Silicon Labs is now located in the directory:

examples\arm-cm\game_efm32-slstk3401a\win32-gui\

****
NOTE: The EFM32-SLSTK3401A board replaces the EK-LM3S811 board, which
has been discontinued.
****

This co-location of the Win32 emulation with the embedded code running
on the actual board demonstrates better the "dual targeting" development
approach.
