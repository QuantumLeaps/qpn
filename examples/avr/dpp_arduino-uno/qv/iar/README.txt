About The DPP-AVR Example
=========================
This directory contains the DPP example for the 8-bit AVRmega processor family
with the IAR-AVR compiler.

***
NOTE: The Debug build configuration needs to use the high optimization level
(for size) in order to fit under the code size limit of the free KickStart
version of the IAR-AVR toolset.
