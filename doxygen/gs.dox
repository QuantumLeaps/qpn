<p>The most recommended way of obtaining QP-nano&trade; is by downloading the <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/#Downloads"><b>QP-bundle&trade;</b></a>, which includes QP-nano&trade; as well as other QP frameworks and also the <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/qm/">QM&trade; modeling tool</a> and the <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/">QTools&trade; collection</a>. The main advantage of obtaining QP-nano&trade; bundled together like that is that you get all components, tools and examples ready to go.
