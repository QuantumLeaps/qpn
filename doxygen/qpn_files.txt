\li (1) QP-nano resides in the separate directory branch, called henceforth
QP-nano Root Directory. The essential element of the design is that the QP
Root Directory can be "plugged into" any branch of a hierarchical file system
and you can move the QP-nano Root Directory around, or even have multiple
versions of the QP-nano Root Directories. The ability to relocate the QP-nano
Root Directory means that only relative paths should be used in the Makefiles,
build scripts, workspaces, or project files.

\li (2) The file qpc.chm contains the "QP-nano Reference Manual" in CHM
format.

\li (3) The \c doxygen\\ directory contains this "QP-nano Reference Manual"
generated with the Doxygen utility.

\li (4) The \c html\\ subdirectory contains this HTML verions of the "QP-nano
Reference Manual". In particular, the file index.html is the index page of the
Manual.

\li (5) The \c examples\\ directory contains the application examples that are
included in the standard QP-nano distribution. The structure of the \c
examples\\ is the most complicated because of the large number of choices
available, such as CPU architectures, compilers, and two choices of kernels
(non-preemptive and preemptive).

\li (6) The CPU architecture is placed as the first level of nesting within the
\c examples\\ directory. Examples of CPU architectures are: 80x86, ARM, ARM
Cortex, AVR, MSP430, M16C, etc. Please note that a separate directory is needed
whenever the CPU architecture is significantly different. For example, even
though the traditional ARM and the new ARM Cortex are related, the
differences are significant enough to require a separate directory branch for
ARM and ARM Cortex.

\li (7) The second level of nesting, under the CPU architecture is the
compiler used. For example, the 80x86 port can be compiled with the Open Watcom
or perhaps with Borland C++. Similarly, the port to ARM Cortex with QK
kernel can be compiled with the IAR, RealView, or GNU compilers.

\li (8) Finally, the example application is located in its own directory. For
instance, the \c dpp\\ directory contains the "Dining Philosopher Problem"
application example for this particular CPU/Compiler combination.

\li (9) The \c dpp\\dbg\\ subdirectory contains the object files and the
executable for the Debug configuration.

\li (10) \c make.bat is the batch script for building the application.

\li (11) THe \c qpn_port.h header file contains platform-specific adaptation
(QP-nano) port for this application. 

\note Every QP-nano application must provide its own specific \c qpn_port.h
header file.

\li (12) The \c dpp-qk directory contains the of the application with the
QK-nano preemptive kernel

\li (13) \c make.bat is the batch script for building the application with
QK-nano.

\li (14) All five state designed patterns described in Chapter 5 of
\ref PSiCC2 (PSiCC2) are provided.

\li (15) The directory \c arm-cortex\\ contains QP examples for ARM Cortex.

\li (16) The directory \c msp430\\ contains QP examples for Texas Instruments
MSP430.

\li (17) The directory \c include\\ contains platform-independent header files
for all QP-nano components. You need to point your C compiler to include files
from this directory.

\li (18) The directory \c source\\ contains platform-independent source files
for all QP-nano components.
