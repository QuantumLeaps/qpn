/**
* @description
* Many compilers for 8-bit Harvard-architecture MCUs provide non-stanard
* extensions to support placement of objects in different memories.
* In order to conserve the precious RAM, QP-nano uses the Q_ROM macro for
* all constant objects that can be allocated in ROM.
*
* To override the following empty definition, you need to define the
* Q_ROM macro in the qpn_port.h header file. Some examples of valid
* Q_ROM macro definitions are: __code (IAR 8051 compiler), code (Keil
* 8051 compiler), PROGMEM (gcc for AVR), __flash (IAR for AVR).

* not generate correct code for accessing data allocated in the program
* space (ROM). The workaround for such compilers is to explicitly add
* assembly code to access each data element allocated in the program
* space. The macro Q_ROM_BYTE() retrieves a byte from the given ROM
* address.
*
* The Q_ROM_BYTE() macro should be defined in the qpn_port.h header file
* for each compiler that cannot handle correctly data allocated in ROM
* (such as the gcc). If the macro is left undefined, the default
* definition simply returns the argument and lets the compiler synthesize
* the correct code.
