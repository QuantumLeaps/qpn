About The QP-AVR Port
=====================
This directory contains the QP-nano port to the 8-bit AVRmega processor family
with the GNU-AVR compiler. This port can be built with the standalone WinAVR
toolset (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/), or with
the GNU-AVR toolset that ships with the Atmel Studio.
