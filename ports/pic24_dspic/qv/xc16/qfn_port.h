/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE01:
* The DISI (disable interrupts) instruction is used for very fast,
* unconditional locking and unlocking of interrupts. The DISI #0x3FFF
* instruction disables interrupts for 16383 instruction cycles, which is
* much longer than any critical section in QP-nano. The DISI #0 instruction
* is then used to unconditionally unlock the interrupts at the end of the
* critical section. The DISI instruction only disables interrupts with
* priority levels 1-6. Priority level 7 interrupts and all trap events still
* have the ability to interrupt the CPU when the DISI instruction is active.
* This means that from the perspective of QP-nano, the level 7 interrupts are
* treated as non-maskable interrupts (NMIs). Such non-maskable interrupts
* _cannot_ call any QP-nano services. In particular, they cannot post events.
*
* CAUTION: This QP-nano port assumes that interrupt nesting is _enabled_,
* which is the default in the PIC24/dsPIC processors. Interrupt nesting should
* never be disabled by setting the NSTDIS control bit (INTCON1<15>). If you
* don't want interrupts to nest, you can always prioritize them at the same
* level. For example, the default priority level for all interrupts is 4 out
* of reset. If you don't change this level for any interrupt the nesting of
* interrupt will not occur.
